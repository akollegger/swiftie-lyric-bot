Shouldâ€™ve Said No - Commentary LyricsBecca: We are celebrating the dozen years that have passed since Taylor Swift released her self-titled debut album. And man, I can't believe that it has been that long, and to think about how far Taylor Swift has come in those twelve years. And you know, one of the things that has set Taylor apart in her carreer is her intelligence and her business savvy and knowing who she is as an artist, and even when she was younger, just fifteen, sixteen years old, Taylor knew that it wouldn't be good enough just to cute and be able to do things.

Taylor Swift: There are girls in Nashville who are gorgeous and they have amazing voices and wanted to do the same thing that I wanted to do, and I figured out a way to stand out. And, for me, I went back home and I started playing guitar and writing my own music and, in that sense, I could walk into a room and play my own instrument and I could play songs that I've written and, that way, I wouldn't have to depend on anybody creatively.

Becca: Taylor Swift has certainly embraced that creative freedom with a vengeance and she has gone on to just make some absolutely incredible music. But today, we are celebrating the beginning, the songs that captivated people when they were so young and have led them to become lifelong Taylor fans. And I know a lot of us have sung along to this one at the top of our lungs, feel free to go ahead and do it again.
