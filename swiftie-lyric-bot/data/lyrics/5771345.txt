Should’ve Said No (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Well, yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & Joe Jonas]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
Oh, whoa

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Jonas Brothers, Joe Jonas]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
[Outro]
Ladies and gentleman, Taylor Swift!
