Mary’s Song (Oh My My My) - Commentary LyricsBecca: Twelve years ago, a young country hopeful named Taylor Swift released her debut album by the same name: Taylor Swift. And, since then, she has been making history, setting records, winning over millions of fans, and touching hundreds of thousands of people's lives with her music. And that's what we're doing today, celebrating Taylor Swift's twelfth anniversary since the release of her debut album. And, you know, she has so many different songs that coverеd a wide spectrum on her dеbut album, and Taylor said that was very intentional

Taylor: I think, for me, I just wanted to pick the songs that I thought represented me the best, and, you know, different emotions, and if I had one about being angry, I wasn't gonna put another one on that's about being angry, if I had one about missing somebody, I wasn't gonna put another one on about that. I tried to cover all bases, but not get repetitive so that nobody would be able to pigeonhole me and say, "Oh, this album's all about this, or all about that." I didn't want it to convey just one emotion

Becca: I know a lot of people love "Mary's Song" because it's such a fun and upbeat song. It's off of Taylor Swift's debut album, which is celebrating its twelfth year of release here on Big Machine RadioSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $214You might also like
