Peter (Live From Stockholm) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Forgive me Peter, my lost fearless leader
In closets like Cedar, preserved from when we were just kids
Is it something I did?
The goddess of timing once found us beguiling
She said she was trying, Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Thеn you were gonna come find mе
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, never to keep

[Verse 2]
Are you still a mind-reader, a natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things Peter, but life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me, when crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon
In different galaxies

And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep

[Post-Chorus]
Never to keep

[Bridge]
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you've learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the lost boys, chapter of your life
Forgive me Peter, please know I that I tried to
Hold on to the days when you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light
[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep
