Bette Davis Eyes (Live/2011) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I’m such a fan of and
I’d love to play you  some music I’m a fan of that’s come from LA, is that okay?
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it’s called “Bette Davis Eyes”

[Verse 1]
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes

[Chorus 1]
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes
[Verse 2]
She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes


[Chorus 2]
She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy)
All the boys think she's a spy
