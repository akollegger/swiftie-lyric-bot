Fearless/Iâ€™m Yours/Hey, Soul Sister (Live/2011) Lyrics[Fearless]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

[Fearless]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why when with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[I'm Yours]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
