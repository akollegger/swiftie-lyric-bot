One Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes
Down to my skin
I'm driving away, and I
I guess you could say
This is the last I drive this away again
And there's nothing to say and I
Try to grab at the fray 'cause I
I still love you, but I can't

[Chorus]
Well, bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
Was so sure of everything
Everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
The here and the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming
Part of your past

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah

[Bridge]
There's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you, like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Well, bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah, there was one thing
I knew would never leave me
[Outro]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes
Down to my skin
