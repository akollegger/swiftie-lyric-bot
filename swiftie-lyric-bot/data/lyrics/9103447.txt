Tied Together With A Smile - Commentary LyricsBecca: Thanks for listening to Big Machine Radio. Hey there, I'm Becca, and we are celebrating the milestones in Taylor Swift's carreer because she releases albums in the fall, generally, so right around this time, there was a lot to celebrate. Right now, we are celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of the release of hеr debut album, it happened Octobеr 24th, 2006. Man, I would imagine, as an artist, to know that your music has that kind of an impact on people, it must be incredible. And Taylor does talk about what inspired this really powerful song that so many people were impacted by, "Tied Together With A Smile."

Taylor Swift: One of my best friends is this really pageant queen, you know, beauty queen, everybody wants to be her, all the guys want to date her, and, um, I wrote this song the day that I found out that she had an eating disorder. You know, it's kind of a haughty point in your life when you realize that something that you thought was so strong, you find out that it isn't strong at all, and that she, you know, had a deadly problem. And, um, so, it was a really tough time that I wrote that song and helped her through it, and she's fine now, so it's good.

Becca: And, you know, that's part of the message in this song, that even if you're not okay now, you will be okay, so just hang in there. And this is "Tied Together With A Smile" on Big Machine Radio.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $
