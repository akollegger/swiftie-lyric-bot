Fearless - Commentary Lyrics[Becca]
I'm Becca with Big Machine radio and we are taking a look back at Taylor Swift’s album Fearless, which was released 10 years ago this fall
And so for this special we're gonna hear from Taylor, kind of a flashback to when she released this album, what she was thinking when she wrote the songs and you'll hear every song on that album
We’re gonna start with the title track because that's track one on the album, and here's what Taylor said about about choosing this title for her album

[Taylor Swift]
Fearless to me, I thought about it before we titled the album that, because you really have to make sure it explains this body of work that your putting out
For the last two years of stories you want to tell, so I thought about it, and I thought about what my own personal definition of the word fearless is, and to me, fearless isn't not having any fears, it's not that you're not afraid of anything
I think that being fearless means that you have a lot of fears, but you jump anywaysSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $214You might also like
