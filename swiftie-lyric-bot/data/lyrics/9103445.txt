Cold As You - Commentary LyricsBecca: This is Big Machine Radio, and I think Swifties all over the world know that Taylor Swift likes to release her albums in the fall, usually October or November. That means, this time of year, there are so many milestones to celebrate when it comes to Taylor. In fact, right now, we're celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of the release of her debut album here on Big Machine Radio. Going back, examining some of the songs, and also hearing from Taylor. And, you know, one thing that set Taylor apart back when she was first getting started, you have to know that it was back when MySpace was actually popular, she decided to approach her biography on her MySpace page similar to the way that she approaches her songwriting â€” to be very open and personal and honest.

Taylor Swift: I tried to write my biography not, you know, as somebody else was writing it. You know, a lot of artists have, "So-and-so is the best, you know, musician ever," and I just didn't wanna have my biography be like that, so I decided to write mine in first person. Telling about who I am as a person, what I like, what I don't like, what annoys me, what I love, you know, stuff like that. 'Cause I always wanted my favorite artists to do that. I always thought it would've been cool if the Country artists that I looked up to when I was little would've given the fans something really cool. So I thought it was pretty cool to give these people information about me, 'cause I'm not scared of it.

Becca: Well, it was that willingness to not be scared and to share herself with her fans that have endeared her to them for so long and, of course, the songs have also connected Taylor to her fans forever. I know this song has helped a lot of people find their way out of bad situations. This is "Cold As You," Taylor Swift, on Big Machine Radio.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $
