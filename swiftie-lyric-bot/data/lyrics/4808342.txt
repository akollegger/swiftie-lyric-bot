I Forgot That You Existed (Piano/Vocal) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. I was writing with two writers I hadn't ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called "I Forgot That You Existed", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started

[Sung]
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

(Humming)
I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
(Humming)

I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
