A Place In This World - Commentary LyricsBecca: Thanks for being here with Big Machine Radio and celebrating the twelfth year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album being released. We're going back and reliving some of the memories with Taylor about the album. In fact, Taylor talked about the fact that this debut album was written from her perspective as a young woman and writing about things that meant something to her.

Taylor Swift: Well, you know, there's different songs about different things, and thеn I'll be the first one to stand up and say, "Look, I'm sеventeen, never got married or had a kid and I'm not gonna write the songs about that, but I will write about what I have been through and what my friends have been through." You know, I think, at a young age, I developed a really keen sense of observation and just being able to watch people and how they communicate with each other.

Becca: And, you know, when I went back and read some of the commentary that fans have posted about Taylor Swift's debut album, it was obvious that, this next song, they were able to relate to on a very personal level. This is called "A Place In This World," of Taylor Swift's debut album on Big Machine Radio.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $
