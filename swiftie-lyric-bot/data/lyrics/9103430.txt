Picture To Burn - Commentary LyricsBecca: This is Big Machine Radio and we're celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album, also called Taylor Swift, which she released back in October of 2006. We're playing all of the songs on the album, going back and hearing from Taylor at that time. And, y'know, Taylor will never forget a faithful meeting with Scott Borchetta after she's just finished playing at the Bluebird Cafe here in Nashville.

Taylor Swift: He came up to me after the show and was, likе, "Um, I'm working on something and I want you to be a part of it, but I can't talk to you about it right now" and what that meant was that hе was still at Universal Records. He was MVP at Universal Records and what that meant was that he was starting off a brand new label and wanted me to be on it. So, that label turned out to be Big Machine Records.

Becca: We here at Big Machine could not be prouder of Taylor and everything that she has gone on to accomplish since she released her debut album back in 2006. And I'm sure you've heard this song from Taylor, it's "Picture To Burn" on Big Machine Radio.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $
