Tennessee Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Bridge]
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee
