The Outside - Commentary LyricsBecca: We are celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of the release of Taylor Swift's self-titled debut album and it has been an incredible twelve years, to say the least. You know, there are many songs on Taylor Swift's debut CD that people latched on to or related to, it's probably because she was willing to open up and share her personal feelings about what she was going through, and so many people were in that exact same position, going through that exact situation when they were in school and, for Taylor, it was a very true and honest story.

Taylor Swift: I wrote the song "The Outside" and it was when I was, um, youngers and stuff in middle school. I wasn't accepted, I was kind of an outcast, on the outside looking in, and I wrote that song about it. And I thought it was important to include it on the album because I wasn't always in this position. I didn't always have a lot of people around me, and I think it's important to remember where you came from and remember when you weren't on top of the world.

Becca: Like so many of her songs, a lot of people turn to Taylor Swift's "The Outside" to help them navegate the waters when it didn't quite feel like they belonged.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $
