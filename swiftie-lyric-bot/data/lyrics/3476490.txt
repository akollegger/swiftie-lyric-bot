Sugar Lyrics[Verse 1]
What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on

[Pre-Chorus]
But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

[Chorus]
And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Verse 2]
With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing

And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

[Chorus]
And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Bridge]
Oh, there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

[Chorus]
And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find
He calls her "Sugar"
