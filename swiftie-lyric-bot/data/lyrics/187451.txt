Your Face Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared of
What love
Gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 2]
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared of
What love
Gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 3]
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared of
What love
Gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face
[Outro]
Oh no no
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to turn around
Oh-oh lose your face, yeah
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to lose your face
