You All Over Me (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain
Has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones
On old county roads
They leave it muddy underneath
Reminds me of you

[Verse 2]
You find graffiti on the walls
Of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket
That's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Sworе that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gеts you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe
Reminds me of back then

[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows too long
And wasted my time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around see
That we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Outro]
I've still got you all, oh-oh, over me
Na-na-na

Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
La-da-dum, la-da-dum
La-da-da-da, all over me
Da-da-dum, la-la-da
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
All over you, you all over me
Ah-oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, ah, oh
All over me
