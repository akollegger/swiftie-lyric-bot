Honey Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say


[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


[Verse 2]
Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!


[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
