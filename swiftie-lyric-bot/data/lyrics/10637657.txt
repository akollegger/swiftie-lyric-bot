How Did It End? (Live from Stockholm) Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hothouse flower to my outdoorsmen
Our maladies were such, we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birth right became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know, how did it end?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learnеd the right steps to differеnt dances
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
And soon they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins

Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off
One gasp, and then "How did it end?"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah, oh-woah

[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle grieving
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me berethed and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree, D-Y-I-N-G

[Chorus]
It's happenin' again, how did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand, how did it end?
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of your friends
But I still don't know, how did it end?
