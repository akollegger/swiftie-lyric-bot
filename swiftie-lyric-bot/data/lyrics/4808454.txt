Lover (Piano/Vocal) Lyrics[Spoken]
Writing the song "Lover" was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record. So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into. And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano. And this is what happened So it is, it's basically, I don't see it as a piano. I think it's that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so.

[Sung: Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Sung: Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Spoken]
Yeah, I love the walk down. I love the walk down. I was trying to figure out "what the hell is gonna happen there"
So the, so.

[Sung]
My, my, my, my lover

[Sung: Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash on the couches
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $214[Sung: Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Spoken]
Okay and then I have this bridge thing that's um, essentially, Well, no I was, I did, I did it in this key, but it could be like a thing where it's like a key change. So it plays off of the walk down-ish. But it's, this is the melody of it, it goes, it's like

[Sung: Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hands
I take this magnetic force-
Oh, ****
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

[Spoken]
Wait, so goes...

[Sung: Bridge]
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat
[Spoken]
So goes, and you, it goes...

[Sung: Bridge]
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
My heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat

[Spoken]
You like? Yeah! I've never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday.
