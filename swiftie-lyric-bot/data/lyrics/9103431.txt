Teardrops On My Guitar - Radio Single Remix / Commentary LyricsBecca: Celebration, a week of milestones. We are revisiting all of Taylor Swift's albums and celebrating their anniversaries. It's the twelfth year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album and we are playing all of the tracks off of her debut album, which came out October 24th, 2006. I know a lot of people could relate to this song. Taylor said, "You know what? The guy at the time probably didn't know how I felt, but he did after this song came out."

Taylor Swift: It's a song that I wrote about this guy who I had a big crush on, sat next to me in class, and he would come in to talk about his girlfriend every single day, and how pretty she was and how happy they were, and I never told him that I liked him, but I did write a song with his name in it, so, um, I guess the secret's out now. You know, that song is really about hiding how you really feel.

Becca: Yeah, I'd say the cat was definitely out of the bag after that one. And you know, the thing about Taylor Swift's song, "Teardrops On My Guitar," it was so relatable to so many people, as are so many of Taylor Swift's songs.
