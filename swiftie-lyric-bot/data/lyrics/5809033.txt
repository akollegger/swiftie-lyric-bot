​cardigan (voice memo) LyricsSo first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I can't believe you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the "Maple" one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing. 

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $214You might also like[Chorus]
But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I
I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool
Breaking every damn rule, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Instrumental Break]
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 

[Bridge]
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now I'm bleedin'
I'm bleedin'

[Instrumental Break]
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait 'til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending. 
[Chorus]
I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind

And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it.
