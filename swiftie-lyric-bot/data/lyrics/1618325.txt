I Want You Back (Live/2011) Lyrics[Chorus]
Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Oh won’t  you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back(I want you back), ooh-ooh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Oh-woah-oh

Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Won’t  you please let me
Back in your heart?
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
