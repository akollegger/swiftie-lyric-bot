A Place In This World (Live from SoHo) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
So, we're gonna have the band take a little tiny break and I'm gonna play you a song that, uh, I wrote this when I was like thirteen years old and just moved to Nashville, and I knew that I wanted to end up making music and on a record label, but I didn't know how I was going to get there. And I wrote this song about it

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
'Cause I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
