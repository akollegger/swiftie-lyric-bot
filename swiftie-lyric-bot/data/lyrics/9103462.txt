Fifteen - Commentary Lyrics[Becca]
Thanks for listening to Big Machine radio as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of Taylor Swift's Fearless album, and perhaps one of the most poignant songs on this album and I think one that affected so many young people is Fifteen

[Taylor Swift]
Its a song that I wrote about my freshman year of high school and that was one of the most life-changing years for me because I hadn't had my first boyfriend and that I had all these experiences like I met my best friend
We met in English class in our frеshman year of high school on the first day, and um, it just really kind of chroniclеs exactly what happened that year, and how we both kind of grew up in different ways
I grew up when I realised that I didn't really wanna spend as much time with my boyfriend, I wanted to go be writing songs and going on the road and trying to be a singer
She grew up because her heart absolutely got broken into pieces, and its like that song, I'm just really glad that I was able to put those feelings in that story into words; and its really, its an emotional song for me I kinda- I broke down while I was singing the last chorus on the record, you can kinda hear it in my voice that I'm really, really, shaking upSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $214You might also like
