Mine - Commentary Lyrics[Becca Walls, 2018]
This is Big Machine Radio, hey there I'm Becca and you know, it was the fall of 2010 when Taylor Swift released her first studio album, "Speak Now", which means it's celebrating its eigth anniversary this year, so we thought we would take a look back at this album
I would say that this was probably Taylor Swift's final full-fledged country album, because her next album "Red" we started to feel a little bit of those pop inclinations in some of her songs, but we're gonna take a look back, I had a chance to talk to Taylor back in 2010 when she released this album and we talked about every single song, what it meant to her, what inspired the songs, and we're gonna play the entire album as well, as we hear from Taylor

The first song on this album is "Mine"

[Taylor Swift, 2010]
The first single of the record is called "Mine", and it's a song that is about, kind of, my tendency to run from love, it's been sort of, a recent tendency and I think it's because for me every really direct example of love that I've had in front of me has ended in goodbye and has ended in breakups and things like that, and so I think I've developed this pattern of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship, and this song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realise that it can work out

[Becca Walls, 2018]
And you know it's interesting, 8 years later we can see that Taylor Swift has found that person that has made her believe in love with Joe Alwyn, and I'm so happy for her. But this was the first single she released off her album, "Speak Now", this is "Mine", on Big Machine RadioSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $214You might also like
