Why Do You Tell Me? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I tried to impress you
It didn’t matter to you, I don’t matter to you
But you tried to make me think I was crazy
“Put all these dreams on hold,” that’s what I was being told

[Pre-Chorus]
Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, “Ooh, you’re gonna bring me down”
But I don’t need to know what you don’t need to show
Well I don’t wanna go down

[Chorus]
So why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

[Verse 2]
It hurts so bad to hear you say it
Did I really go so wrong? Tell me now, what’s going on?
Hearts fall like a broken angel
Did you mean to break me down every time I turn around?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, “Ooh, you’re gonna bring me down”
But I don’t need to know what you don’t need to show
Well I don’t wanna go down

So why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

[Outro]
Why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me
