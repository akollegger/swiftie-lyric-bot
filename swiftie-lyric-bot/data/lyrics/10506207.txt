That’s When (Demo) Lyrics[Intro: Brett Warren &  Taylor Swift ]
You ready? Yeah, let's try
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I said, "I know"
When he said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And I watched him go
And he watched me crash to the floor
On my knees, just like that

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Then he said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
I said

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, I'll let you in
Yeah, baby, that's when"

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I said, "I know"
When he said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this”
'Cause I let you go, and you let me
Think that I'd be fine without you, imagine that

So, baby, when can I come back?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, I'll let you in
And baby, that's when

[Interlude: Brad Warren]
Do a bridge right here

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And I said, "Honestly
Did you ever think of me?"
And he said

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
When I was laughing, when I was crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, you let me in
And baby, that's when”
[Outro: Brad Warren, Taylor Swift, Both]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's, oh-oh-oh, storming
Oh-oh-oh-oh, laughing, crying
Ah-ah, oh-oh That's when
Oh-oh-oh That's when
Oh-oh I'll let you in
Baby, that's when
I said, "I know"
When he said, "I need some time, need some space"
