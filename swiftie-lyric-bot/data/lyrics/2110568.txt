Drops of Jupiter (Live/2011) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
You know, you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

[Verse 1]
Well, now he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
But since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
That heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Well, now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Well, now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me, did this wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Refrain]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte you have ever had, and me?

[Chorus]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day, hey
Head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself?
[Interlude]

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Refrain]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?
