Brand New World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday, I'm gonna fly

[Verse 2]
Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I'm proud of

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday, I'm gonna fly

And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine

[Chorus]
I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday, I'm gonna fly
