The Alchemy X Treacherous Mashup (Live From Paris) Lyrics[Part I: The Alchemy]

[Verse 1]
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong

[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
Who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong

[Part II: Treacherous]

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it
Like it
Like it

[Part III: The Alchemy]

[Bridge]
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over your heads
Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
"There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league"
Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me
[Chorus]
Touchdown
Call the amateurs, cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Post-Chorus]
Who are we to fight the alchemy?
Who are we to fight it?
Who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Part IV: Treacherous / The Alchemy]

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
[Outro]
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
