But Daddy I Love Him (Acoustic Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you to cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighin', "What a mess"
I just learned these people try to save you 'cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse for a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door on my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not comin' to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

"Stay away from her," the saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screechin' tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not comin' to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you somethin' right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you somethin' 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh)
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
(Ah-ah-ah) Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
(Ah-ah-ah) Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry, and undo the destiny
(Ah-ah-ah) You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy (Joy)
(Ah-ah-ah) If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town
That I bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride
But brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out
But fuck 'em, it's over

[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun
And even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my god, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the weddin'
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you somethin' right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy (Joy)
He was chaos, he was revelry
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice
[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not (Ah-ah-ah)
But you should see your faces
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
But, oh my god, you should see your faces

[Outro]
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
