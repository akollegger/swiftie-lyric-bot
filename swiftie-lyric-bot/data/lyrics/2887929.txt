Better Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know, I'm probably better off on my own
Than loving a man who didn't know what we had when we had it
And I see, the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Verse 2]
I wish it wasn't 4AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it,"
I know, the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 3]
I know, I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

[Verse 4]
But your jealousy
Oh, I can hear it now
Talkin' down to me, like I'd always be around
Pushed my love away
Like it was some kinda loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Liz Huett]
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love if you were a better man
(I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[Outro]
A better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man
