Beautiful Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes, I think of you late at night
I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are lookin' into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your—
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while, I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are lookin' into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your—
I'm looking through your eyes

[Bridge]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your, dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Beautiful eyes
